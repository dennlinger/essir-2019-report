# ESSIR 2019 & FDIA Student Review
By Dennis Aumiller on July 24th, 2019

In its 12th edition, the [European Summer School in Information Retrieval](http://www.ir.disco.unimib.it/essir2019/) returned to its Italian roots in beautiful Milan, where it took place at the University of Milano-Bicocca between July 15th to July 19th, 2019.
Maristella Agosti (University of Padua), who was organizer of the first summer school back in 1990, again co-organized the event, together with Nicola Ferro (University of Padua) and Gabriella Pasi (University of Milan-Bicocca).

Around 40 students from as far as Chile and China attended the event, which is primarily geared towards early-stage researchers.
During the week, attendees could enjoy talks on a wide variety of topics held by established members of the IR community.<br/>
For many attendees, especially more senior ones, the schedule of the summer school also fit neatly with further travel plans to attend SIGIR 2019, which started on the subsequent Sunday in Paris.


Co-located with ESSIR was the 9th PhD Symposium on Future Directions in Information Access (FDIA), this year with PCs Ingo Frommholz (University of Bedfordshire), Haiming Liu (University of Bedfordshire) and Yashar Moshfeghi (University of Strathclyde). In total the event received more than 20 submissions, out of which 7 were chosen for oral presentation, and 12 displayed during a poster session.

## First Day
After a warm welcome by the organizers, Maarten de Rijke opened the summer school with his talk, introducing the students to a theoretical framework of IR research that allows the categorization of later talks. Especially his quote "Information Retrieval [is] getting the **right** information to the **right** people in the **right** way" was highlighted quite a few times throughout to week to illustrate the relevance of the users in the equation.
A more historical overview was then also presented by Bruce Croft, who commented on the past and present research opportunities in Information Retrieval.<br/>
During the afternoon sessions, Nicola Ferro and Julio Gonzalo presented the difficulty of proper evaluation in IR. Both of them also touched on an issue that was strongly echoed by subsequent speakers: Reproducibility is one of key challenges -- not only in IR, but in general -- of our time and needs to be addressed properly, to ensure the meaningful advancement in research.

## Second Day
During the morning session, the topic was quite different from the previous day and focusing on the user-oriented aspect in IR. While Nick Belkin introduced various perception models for the Informatin Retrieval process, starting from the first important works by Cleverdon, Diane Kelly walked the students through a history of different user interfaces, all the way to modern smartphone interfaces.<br/>
During the afternoon session by Claudia Hauff, students learned the value of a well-tuned baseline, and how neural IR models are not the solution to every problem, especially with respect to explainability and reproducibility. Gabriella Pasi concluded the day by introducing the notion of context in IR, as to avoid a "one size fits all" approach.

## Wednesday
After two intense days of more theoretically inclined lectures, Wednesday brought two refreshing morning sessions by Nicola Tonellotto and Carlos Castillo.
Again, the discrepancy between the research in industry and academia became a central aspect of the talk by Nicola Tonellotto, who offered a glimpse into the issues of production systems at scale, and what measures can be taken to implement many of the great ideas and techniques in practice.
Carlos Castillo on the other hand talked about mining social networks, and also warned the students to not blindly follow correlations or data that could be obtained way easier. <br/>
The afternoon sessions were taken over by the FDIA paper presentations, which were on a diverse set of topics, from EEG measures of "relevance" to a tinder-like app for museums. For some of the speakers it was the first time they were given an opportunity to speak in front of a larger body of peers, but all presenters did a great job at conveying their material to the attendees.

## Thursday
Opening the morning sessions was Henning Müller, who identified some of the key challenges of IR in medical contexts; he also stressed the importance of interdisciplinary work. In his opinion, students should either really try to understand the material to its fullest, or refrain from participating in interdisciplinary activities (which need not be a bad thing). Paolo Cremonesi followed up with a fundamental lecture on a very related topic -- recommender systems. During his session, he made sure to cover a wide variety of problem variations in the field and formalize the problem to the students.<br/>
In a panel during the first afternoon session under the moderation of Maristella Agosti, students had the chance to give an early feedback on the event structure and potential future directions of ESSIR. Furthermore, the panelists Ricardo Baeza-Yates, Bruce Croft, Diane Kelly and Henning Müller were addressing the students' questions from anything regarding the summer school organization to more general questions about IR education or planning of PhD topics.
Afterwards, the second part of the FDIA symposium took place with a poster session to allow more students to explain their research topics to the audience.

Continuing the conversations from the previous sessions at a social dinner in a typical Italian restaurant, further exchange was facilitated by the organizers and emphasized the almost family-like atmosphere at the event. In addition, the FDIA chairs awarded Best Paper awards to Dennis Dosso (presentation) and Emma Gerritse (poster), although they stressed how hard the decision was due to the number of great submissions.

## Friday
During the last day, Emine Yilmaz talked about understanding and inferring user needs, for which she explained the difficulty of multitasking from a system design point of view. Especially tracking user behaviour across multiple sessions is still a topic worth exploring, and sees further research put out each year.
As the final talk, Ricardo Baeza-Yates' session on biases in web search and recommenders was already hotly anticipated by many attendees, as the topic had already been mentioned by many of the other speakers, and seemed to fit very well in the context of current research interests. He convincingly layed out the proposal that no one is immune to all biases, and that the sheer variety of problems -- broadly categorized in cultural, statistical or cognitive biases -- needs a very determined researcher to realize the interplay of different factors in datasets. <br/>
To conclude a week of intense learning experience, this years' edition introduced 

## Impressions
As a PhD student that started just two months ago, ESSIR & FDIA were the perfect place to be in order to get a broad foundation in IR, especially since many universities still do not have dedicated (or mandatory) IR lectures in place.
Aside from the obvious learning, meeting peers that are in a somewhat similar position helps immensely to start building a network of potential future collaborators and friends. Especially facilitated through the symposium's presentations, it became clear what individuals are working on or planning for their future experiments.<br/>
That, together
