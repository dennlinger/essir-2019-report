# ESSIR 2019 & FDIA Student Review
By Dennis Aumiller on July 24th, 2019

In its 12th edition, the [European Summer School in Information Retrieval](http://www.ir.disco.unimib.it/essir2019/) returned to its Italian roots in beautiful Milan, where it took place at the University of Milano-Bicocca between July 15th to July 19th, 2019.
Maristella Agosti (University of Padua), who was organizer of the first summer school back in 1990, again co-organized the event, together with Nicola Ferro (University of Padua) and Gabriella Pasi (University of Milan-Bicocca).

Around 40 students from as far as Chile and China attended the event, which is primarily geared towards early-stage researchers.
During the week, attendees could enjoy talks on a wide variety of topics held by established members of the IR community.<br/>
For many attendees, especially more senior ones, the schedule of the summer school also fit neatly with further travel plans to attend SIGIR 2019, which started on the subsequent Sunday in Paris.


Co-located with ESSIR was the 9th PhD Symposium on Future Directions in Information Access (FDIA), this year with PCs Ingo Frommholz (University of Bedfordshire), Haiming Liu (University of Bedfordshire) and Yashar Moshfeghi (University of Strathclyde). In total the event received more than 20 submissions, out of which 7 were chosen for oral presentation, and 12 displayed during a poster session.

## First Day
After a warm welcome by the organizers, Maarten de Rijke opened the summer school with his talk, introducing the students to a theoretical framework of IR research that allows the categorization of later talks. Especially his quote "Information Retrieval [is] getting the **right** information to the **right** people in the **right** way" was highlighted quite a few times throughout to week to illustrate the relevance of the users in the equation.
A more historical overview was then also presented by Bruce Croft, who commented on the past and present research opportunities in Information Retrieval.<br/>
During the afternoon sessions, Nicola Ferro and Julio Gonzalo presented the difficulty of proper evaluation in IR. Both of them also touched on an issue that was strongly echoed by subsequent speakers: Reproducibility is one of key challenges -- not only in IR, but in general -- of our time and needs to be addressed properly, to ensure the meaningful advancement in research.

## Second Day
During the morning session, the topic was quite different from the previous day and focusing on the user-oriented aspect in IR. While Nick Belkin introduced various perception models for the Informatin Retrieval process, starting from the first important works by Cleverdon, Diane Kelly walked the students through a history of different user interfaces, all the way to modern smartphone interfaces.<br/>
During the afternoon session by Claudia Hauff, students learned the value of a well-tuned baseline, and how neural IR models are not the solution to every problem, especially with respect to explainability and reproducibility. Gabriella Pasi concluded the day by

## Impressions
As a PhD student that started just two months ago, ESSIR & FDIA were the perfect place to be in order to get a broad foundation in IR, especially since many universities still do not have dedicated (or mandatory) IR lectures in place.
Aside from the obvious learning, meeting peers that are in a somewhat similar position helps immensely to start building a network of potential future collaborators and friends. Especially facilitated through the symposium's presentations, it became clear what individuals are working on or planning for their future experiments.
